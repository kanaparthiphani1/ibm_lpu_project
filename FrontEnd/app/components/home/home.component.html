  <p style="letter-spacing: 1px">Hospitalmanagement.net houses a unique portfolio of services that keep healthcare professionals abreast of the latest and most significant developments within their clinical, surgical or management area.

    Covering all aspects of the hospital environment, hospitalmanagement.net provides both clinical and senior administrative staff with instant access to a comprehensive reference source introducing technologies, services and procedures our audience can employ to improve the management of their facilities.

    The site is complemented by two specialist journals, Practical Patient Care and Medical Imaging Technology concentrating on woundcare and infection control and medical imaging and radiology respectively.

    Both titles are circulated to an audience that includes not only clinicians with the authority to recommend new products, but also the managerial staff responsible for purchasing. By reaching both ends of the procurement chain we offer our advertisers the best possible platform from which to sell their services.</p>
